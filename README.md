## Concept

A polkadot powered geolocation based game that uses moonbeam to mint nfts as rewards for exploration, encouraging travel and tourism

## Description

Our application is a game that encourages tourism and exploration using Polkadot via Moonbeam to gamify achievements with NFTs as rewards. We exploit the highspeed minting power of Polkadot parachains to support responsive, interactive mechanics in our games so that users will experience little latency in recieving their rewards. Our app allows users to use location information to retrieve nearby points of interests/monuments/landmarks which they can travel to and take a picture. Our frontend provides a map and a camera interface so users can take their own pictures of landmarks, which will be minted as a NFT and added to their wallet, allowing them to have a permanent souvenir of their accomplishment.

### Technical

Developed on the moonbeam alpha test net (a parachain of Polkadot) to build main logic of application, registration of Landmarks, minting visits into rewards and querying of sites of intereset based on geographic location. We used Metamask as the smart wallet and the Wagmi sdk to interact with the deployed smart contract. We used Pinata as a IPFS gateway to support decentralised file storage for minting image URIs into NFTs.
